## Math ``数学基础课``

#### CS 103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing  计算数学基础

#### CS 109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists 计算机概率导论

## Science ``科学基础课``

#### PHYS（物理） 43 Electricity and Magnetism (or PHYS 23 or 63) 电磁学

## Engineering Fundamentals ``工程学基础课``

#### [CS 106 Programming Abstractions (B or X)](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106B)  ``程序抽象``应该类似于于软件工程

>  This course is the natural successor to Programming Methodology and  covers such advanced programming topics as recursion, algorithmic  analysis, and data abstraction using the C++ programming language, which  is similar to both C and Java. If you've taken the Computer Science AP  exam and done well (scored 4 or 5) or earned a good grade in a college  course, Programming Abstractions may be an appropriate course for you to  start with, but often Programming Abstractions (Accelerated) is a  better choice. Programming Abstractions assumes that you already have  familiarity with good programming style and software engineering issues  (at the level of Programming Methodology), and that you can use this  understanding as a foundation on which to tackle new topics in  programming and data abstraction. 
>
> Topics: Abstraction and its relation to programming. Software  engineering principles of data abstraction and modularity.  Object-oriented programming, fundamental data structures (such as  stacks, queues, sets) and data-directed design. Recursion and recursive  data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs). Introduction to time and  space complexity analysis. Uses the programming language C++ covering  its basic facilities.
>
>  Prerequisites: Solid performance in Programming Methodology and  readiness to move on to advanced programming topics. A comparable  introductory programming course (including high school AP courses) is  often a reasonable substitute for our Programming Methodology.   

 

#### [Introductory Electronics (ENGR 40 also allowed; see note 4)](https://summer.stanford.edu/courses/engr-40a-introductory-electronics) ``电子学导论``

> Overview of electronic circuits and applications. Electrical quantities 
> and their measurement, including operation of the oscilloscope. Basic 
> models of electronic components including resistors, capacitors, 
> inductors, and operational amplifiers. Lab. Lab assignments. Enrollment 
> limited to 300.

   ## CS AI Track Core, Depth, and Senior Project ``专业课``

#### [CS 107 Computer Organization and System](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/) ``计算机组成与系统 理解计算机执行程序/操纵数据``

> CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming  sequence. The CS106 courses provide you with a solid foundation in  programming methodology and abstractions, and CS107 follows on this to  build up and expand your breadth and depth of programming experience and  techniques. The course will work from the C programming language down  to the microprocessor to de-mystify the machine. With a complete  understanding of how computer systems execute programs and manipulate  data, you will become a more effective programmer, especially in dealing  with issues of debugging, performance, portability, and robustness.   Topics covered include: the C programming language, data representation,  machine-level code, computer arithmetic, elements of code compilation,  optimization of memory and runtime performance, and memory organization  and management.

#### [CS 110 Principles of Computer Systems ](http://scpd.stanford.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=11716) ``计算机系统原理 （软+硬）``

>Expand your knowledge of engineering computer systems and develop a 
>critical perspective. This course covers the principles and practice of 
>engineering of computer software and hardware systems, including 
>techniques for controlling complexity, virtual memory, and threads. 
>Systems concepts will be reinforced and practiced using relevant case 
>studies.

#### [CS 161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms ](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1138/) ``算法设计与分析``

> This course will cover the basic approaches and mindsets for analyzing 
> and designing algorithms and data structures. Topics include the 
> following: Worst and average case analysis. Recurrences and asymptotics.
> Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and selection. Data 
> structures: binary search trees, heaps, hash tables. Algorithm design 
> techniques: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, 
> amortized analysis, randomization. Algorithms for fundamental graph 
> problems: minimum-cost spanning tree, connected components, topological 
> sort, and shortest paths. Possible additional topics: network flow, 
> string searching.

### 限选 以下中7门/25 unit

#### [CS 221 AI: Principles and Techniques (Track Requirement  A)](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/)  ``AI原理与技术``

> In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these applications and practice implementing some of these systems.
